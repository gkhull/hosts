This repository contains my personal hosts files.
Pick an option sorted by most to least protection.

OPTION 1: Use blacklist.txt, the blacklist in conjunction with annoyances.txt the annoyances list, and whitelist.txt, the whitelist.

OPTION 2: use greylist.txt if you cannot whitelist for any reason

The format is using Ublock's ||example.com^ style blocking rules

[Greylist Link](https://hosts.gkhull.com/greylist.txt)

Feel free to use <a href="https://hosts.gkhull.com/doh.txt">doh.txt</a> to block DOH domains. This won't prevent anyone from hardcoding but i've found it less common for applications to hardcode the IP instead of using the domain.
